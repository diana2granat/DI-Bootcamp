--     4) Create a new table called new_film with the following columns : id, name. Add some new films to the table.
--======================answer=========================================================
-- CREATE TABLE new_film (
--     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
--     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
-- );
-- INSERT INTO new_film (name) VALUES
-- ('Film A'),
-- ('Film B'),
-- ('Film C');

--     5) Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.
--     Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
--     It should have the following columns:
--         review_id â€“ a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
--         film_id â€“ references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
--         language_id â€“ references the language table. What language the review is in.
--         title â€“ the title of the review.
--         score â€“ the rating of the review (1-10).
--         review_text â€“ the text of the review. No limit on the length.
--         last_update â€“ when the review was last updated.
--======================answer=========================================================
-- CREATE TABLE customer_review (
--     review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
--     film_id INT NOT NULL,
--     language_id INT NOT NULL,
--     title VARCHAR(255),
--     score INT CHECK (score >= 1 AND score <= 10),
--     review_text TEXT,
--     last_update TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
--     FOREIGN KEY (film_id) REFERENCES new_film(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
--     FOREIGN KEY (language_id) REFERENCES language(language_id)
-- );

--     6) Add 2 movie reviews. Make sure you link them to valid objects in the other tables.
--======================answer=========================================================
-- INSERT INTO customer_review (film_id, language_id, title, score, review_text)
-- VALUES (1, 2, 'Great Movie!', 9, 'This movie was fantastic!');

-- INSERT INTO customer_review (film_id, language_id, title, score, review_text)
-- VALUES (1, 1, 'Great Movie!', 9, 'This movie was fantastic. I highly recommend it.');

--     7) Delete a film that has a review from the new_film table, what happens to the customer_review table?
-- DELETE FROM new_film WHERE id = 1;
-- The movie is deleted and the its review is deleted
