# üåü Exercise 1 
# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, 
# and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions

#     Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
#     Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
#         bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
#         run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
#         fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

#     Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

# Exercise 4 : Family
# Instructions

#     Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:
#         members: list of dictionaries
#         last_name : (string)

#     Implement the following methods:
#         born: adds a child to the members list (use **kwargs), don‚Äôt forget to print a message congratulating the family.
#         is_18: takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns True if they are over 18 and False if not.
#         family_presentation: a method that prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details.

#     Create an instance of the Family class, with the last name of your choice, and the below members. Then call all the methods you created in Point 2.

#         [
#             {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False},
#             {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False}

# familiada.born(name='Natali', age=0, gender='Male', is_child=True)
# familiada.family_presentation()


# Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family
# Instructions
#     Create a class called TheIncredibles. This class should inherit from the Family class:
#     This is no random family they are an incredible family, therefore the members attributes, will be a list of dictionaries containing the additional keys : power and incredible_name. 
#     (See Point 4)
#     Add a method called use_power, this method should print the power of a member only if they are over 18 years old. 
#     If not raise an exception (look up exceptions) which stated they are not over 18 years old.
#     Add a method called incredible_presentation which :
#         Print a sentence like ‚Äú*Here is our powerful family **‚Äù
#         Prints the family‚Äôs last name and all the members‚Äô details (ie. use the super() function, to call the family_presentation method)
#     Create an instance of the Incredibles class, with the ‚ÄúIncredibles‚Äù last name, and the below members.
#         [
#             {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False,'power': 'fly','incredible_name':'MikeFly'},
#             {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False,'power': 'read minds','incredible_name':'SuperWoman'}
#         ]
#     Call the incredible_presentation method.
#     Use the born method inherited from the Family class to add Baby Jack with the following power: ‚ÄúUnknown Power‚Äù.
#     Call the incredible_presentation method again.
